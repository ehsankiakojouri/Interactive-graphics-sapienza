# üïπÔ∏è Light or Sting

**Light or Sting** is a real-time interactive game developed as part of the **Interactive Graphics** course at **Sapienza University of Rome**. In this game, players use a virtual **slingshot** to eliminate aggressive hornets while carefully avoiding friendly fireflies that illuminate the scene. The game challenges the player's reflexes and attention to detail, blending gameplay with basic interactive graphics principles.


This repository contains the finalized version submitted for the course, complete with polished assets and core mechanics.

## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

- **Goal**: Shoot hornets using the slingshot to score points.
- **Avoid**: Hitting fireflies ‚Äî doing so results in a penalty. They are the source of light at night to see the hornets.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Launch slime projectiles at hornets using the slingshot.
  - Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and use the arrow keys to aim. Release <kbd>Shift</kbd> to fire.
  - If your slime hits the ground, a new projectile automatically spawns at the slingshot.
