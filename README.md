This repository contains coursework and project implementations completed for the Interactive Graphics course at Sapienza University.

## Projects

### 🖼️ Project 1 – Composing Images
Implementation of alpha blending to composite a foreground image onto a background image using JavaScript.

### 🔄 Project 2 – 2D Transformations
Implementation of 2D transformations (scaling, rotation, translation) using matrix operations in JavaScript to simulate UAV movement.

### 🔀 Project 3 – 3D Transformations and Mesh Rendering
Implementation of 3D rotation matrices, Model-View-Projection pipeline, and a WebGL `MeshDrawer` for textured 3D mesh rendering with axis swapping and texture toggling.

### ☀️ Project 4 – Shading
Extension of the mesh renderer with per-fragment shading, normal transformations, and adjustable material properties.

### 🔦 Project 5 – GPU Ray Tracing
Implementation of a GLSL ray tracer for rendering reflections and shadows on sphere-based scenes.

### 🏃 Project 6 – Mass‑Spring Animations
Real-time simulation of a deformable object using a mass–spring system with collision handling and WebGL visualization.

### 🕹️ Light or Sting – Mini Game
A small WebGL game featuring a slingshot to shoot hornets while avoiding fireflies.
