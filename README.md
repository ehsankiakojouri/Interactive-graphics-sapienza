This repository contains coursework and project implementations completed for the Interactive Graphics course at Sapienza University.

## Projects

### 🖼️ Project 1 – Composing Images
Implementation of alpha blending to composite a foreground image onto a background image using JavaScript.

### 🔄 Project 2 – 2D Transformations
Implementation of 2D transformations (scaling, rotation, translation) using matrix operations in JavaScript to simulate UAV movement.

### 🔀 Project 3 – 3D Transformations and Mesh Rendering
Implementation of 3D rotation matrices, Model-View-Projection pipeline, and a WebGL `MeshDrawer` for textured 3D mesh rendering with axis swapping and texture toggling.

### 💡 Project 4 – Shading
Extension of the mesh renderer to support vertex normals and a Blinn-Phong lighting model with directional light controls.

### 🌐 Project 5 – Ray Tracing
GLSL-based ray tracer with modes for full ray tracing and hybrid rasterization, adding reflections and hard shadows.

### 🌀 Project 6 – Animations
Mass–spring system simulation with collision handling and reusable WebGL tools from earlier projects.

### 🕹️ Light or Sting – Final WebGL Game
Browser game where players use a slingshot to defend fireflies from hornets, built on the course framework.

Each project folder contains a standalone HTML/JS demo. To run any project locally, start a simple web server inside the project directory (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`) and open the corresponding HTML file in a modern browser.

All assignments and the final game are complete, and each can be explored locally as described above.
